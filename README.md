### What is it?
The Snow Globe technique started works as an expansion/deviation of the raycast method.  
It combines this approach with a selection volume, a sphere, that makes the user able to select all the objects inside it.
Besides this, it is also possible to create a copy of the scene delimitated by the selection volume, wich sits on top of the left controller (the snow globe).
This way an user can perform visual manipulation (Rotating and scaling the snow globe itself) or object manipulation (Rotating and moving the objects inside the snow globe).
Every object manipulation that is performed is also reflected on the original object as well.
This way, a user can manipulate objects without the need to physically interact with the world.
